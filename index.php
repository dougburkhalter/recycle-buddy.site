					You hear information every day about making the world a better place, to conserve natural resources, or to help save the ozone layer. Many of you may be skeptical believing the idea: "Oh, I am just one person, what kind of difference can I make?" The truth however, is YOU can make a difference. By making a few, simple changes to your everyday routine you can significantly reduce your carbon footprint. By turning off the lights in a room you are not using, or carpooling with coworkers to work, you are making a beneficial impact on your world. Hey, you might even inspire others around you to do the same. One of the easiest ways to help make such changes is to recycle materials instead of tossing them in a garbage bag that is just left to sit in a landfill somewhere. Welcome to Recycle Buddy! Whether you are already a diligent recycler or you are just starting out, this website and it's smartphone component are right for you. With Recycle Buddy, you can easily search for the nearest recyclingcenters near you. You can search by the city in which you live, or even by the material you wish to recycle. Not good with directions? That's okay, Recycle Buddy will even send the address to a map application for turn-by-turn directions to get you to the center with ease. The best part, it's free! There are no fees for locating places on the website or for downloading the application to your phone. What are you waiting for? Your carbon footprint isn't going to reduce itself! 				</div>			</div>
